if WDAppearRight is in WDStuck, and None in WDAppearLeft, and animation is in WDStuck,
then CannonL will not deactivate even if press button in inspector

removing RotateCanonLeft IsActive property, so that the script will work properly,
and adding opacity insted of activating the object.

01-11-20

ending opening animations and deactivating dialogue panel,
return camera to normal state (size as well as position), play anim to normal state,
have not configured dialogue to appear automatically after door stuck.
( working, not optimised) returning dialogue back to normal. reset the anim speed back to normal.
bug - dialogue 3 wont execute normal.
(fixed) dialogue 0 again was off in the editor.
bug - could not build (fix) need internet

02-11-2020

build made (bug fixed)
bug - ship still moving during dialogue sequence.

bug - dialogue panel is too small.
    :- can be fixed with scale with screen size, dialogue panel and everything goes out of scale.
	:- temp. fixed with scale with screen size and adjusting the scale of both dialogue panel and hide panel
	   x - 800, y - 600, match - 1, match width or height (didn't fix the problem in mobile)
	   tried different settings, didn't fix the problem, going to alternative.
	:- going with contant physical size. going to alt.
	:- trying with scale with screen size, x- 2160, y 1080, match - 1
	
	   -> dialogue panel:- posy - (-109.2), height - 119.5,
	   (previous specs:- height - 71.7, posy - (-60))
	   -> next dialogue button:- height- 60, width - 50, set anchor preset to bottom-right.
	   (pr. specs:- height- 30, width - 25)
	   -> adjusted text width and height.
	   -> dialogues, set anchor preset to center and stretched.
	:- trying with scale with screen size, x-800, y-600, match-0.5
	
	   -> adjusted dialoge panel and dialogue, next dialogue button.
	   -> works on first try.
	   -> adjusted hide dialogue
	   -> dialogues are messed up.
	   
-build made
- spawning Ufo is better in a separate script
- UfoSpwaner and UfoController different script
- UfoController will have shooting mechanics.
- make spawn location of ammo for both enemy and player
- used polygon collider for player, also gave ufo polygon collider
- can make a health bar
- made takeDamage() for both enemy and player
- ammo is recognised both
- made firing point of both enemy and player
- added rigidbody with angular drag-0, gravity scale-0.
- added tag to enemy
- bullets hit both player and enemy
- bullets travel
- set ammo scale to x-0.04 , y-0.2
-enemy have double canon?
- firing bullet(fail)
- make bullet recognise which kind they are
- imma firin mah laser!!!!!
- destroy bullets closer (fixed)
- decrease spawn rate or increase firing rate. (fixed)

03-11-2020

- moved the shootPlayer to FixedUpdate, will move back if it works
- made an if statement to shoot at every 5th frame, assuming it works
- reduced ammo destroy distance to 10, almost near the edge but works
- still too fast, slowing it to 7th or 8th (slow but not enough), slowing it more to 10th 
  (debug shows after every 4 seconds, reset counter)
- ammo was disappearing if camera to far away, fixed it(assuming) by selecting layer as mainScreen.
- increased ammo size from .04 to .07
- set to shoot after all anim done.
- hide panel is off (fixed)
-bug :- bullets not firing properly, too many bullets at start spawning.

      -> moved shoot code to update, maybe fixed problem, shooting rate is not inconsistent
	     as in fixed upadate where, it is fast at beginning and slow later but gets fast after sometime
		 and alternates(maybe)
	  -> update has steady firing rate, 200 is reached in 3 seconds according to debug unlike 4
	     seconds in fixed update
	  ->changing counter to 13th or 14th, reset to 260
	  ->set ammo png max size to 64
	  ->changing counter to 16th or 17th, reset to 320
	  ->changing counter to 22nd, reset to 440
	  ->changing counter to 25th, reset to 500
- can build a common function to turn on temp variables in different scripts.e.g- if all Animation Ended
  , call a function to turn the temp allAnimationEnded trigger in different scripts to on by calling
  public functions which in turn will turn on temp variables or directly turn variables on. (fix)(optimise)
- did not configure, when the right door would open (fix)
- always take the speed of firing body into account. fix the speed of bullet
- now that the rocket is moving, there are only three bullets, increasing despawning distance, 20
  bullets are ok now
- did not configure the stuttering issue.(fix)
- UfoController is too small, including UfoSpwaner also(just realised the mistake)
- UFO does not fire bullet.(fixed)

04-11-2020

- added UFO as a prefab, and added it to the game manager.(may move it to the UFOSpawner)
  moved it.
- use random to spawn at different places, check if a UFO is already present or not, if present then seek
  empty location, if not then get to that location.
- UFO will have common spawn point and travel to designated location.
- disabling move function of both ufo and player.(fixed)
- increase the no of ufo in 2nd line.(if works)(increased)
- make 2 piles, even and odd, if someone is in the upper pile, then lower pile UFO is disabled and
  vice versa
- the spawn points would have to move along with the rocket
- marked the location, now to figue out how to mix all this up
- the upper points are +2 in y-axis from the lower points

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TWO CHOICES
- Make 4 layers with 2 same layers but different y values
  -> more transform information
  -> know how to do it
- Make 2 layers but add a randomizer to spawn at +2 y - values, or original points
  -> less transform information
  -> dont know
  
- Going with second
  -> will have to keep a buffer for the points that already have a UFO
  -> only 1 layer, index can increment to include both upper and lower
  -> can have vector3 as array to store position but ill have to manually input points
  -> how to input +2 y-axis values to buffer?(solved)
  -> set a counter to alternate between 1 and 2, check if its 2, then add 15 to index of the buffer
     , no difference in code required other than this
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

- remove the plane from spawn point prefab.(fixed)
- check if scene has maximum possible UFOs(fixed)
- turn on instantiate/ tuen off possible to spawn

  Error
- <RI.Hid> Failed to create device file:
 2 The system cannot find the file specified.
 
04-11-2020

- first try to see if the spawner works or not.
- fix spawn system, the UFO spawn a little higher than the given points.(fixed)
  -> plustwoiny was not defined correctly.
- 1st and 2nd row were at the ame place , y-3.9 , moved 1st to y-4.9.
- the buffer isn't working properly, upper and lower locations become same.(fixed)
  -> both are different
- tag not set to UFOPrefab.(fixed)
- checking if upper part has a UFO, if it does then do not spawn, does not work properly.(fixed)
  -> checks works properly, including both uppaer and lower positions, and UFO spawn accordingly
- turn on spawn counter if all UFO destroyed.(fixed)
- can set a mechanism to alter the speed of the bullet as the game progresses, making it a little hard (fix)
- UFO firing speed, -0.15 makes it so that the bullet doesnt leave(fixed), -0.2 works(fixed)
  -> translate is ok, fix the rotation, fixed the rotation
  -> firing speed set at 0.15, a little fast
- bullets travel too fast (fixed temp)
- decrease bullet spawn rate, spawn rate at 120, firing speed at -0.2 (base level)
- first test with bullets with moving
  ->spawn rate-240, fire speed- (-0.05), despawn- 41 (done)
- fix despwan distance if ufo is moving.(fixed)
- fix player spawn rate,fire speed, despwan distance (moving).(fixed)
  -> spawn rate-80, despawn-37, fire speed- 0.13
- anim state set to 6 speed.(fix)
- fix UFO bullet despawn rate. (fixed)

06-11-2020

- UFO spawner disabled
- tested wth spawner, UFO bullets are way too fast to dodge.(fixed)
- way too much UFO,no space to dodge(fixed)
  -> spawned no-6, good for now
- optimise raycast, too long, unecessary.(fixed)
- animate UFO Entrance.(fixed)
- made separate code to detect if UFO is destroyed, and decrease counter if destroyed, reset counter
  if all destroyed and respawn again.
- if all destroyed, wait for a few seconds to respawn UFO's again.(fixed)
  -> wait for 2 seconds
- code for boss entrance.(fix)
- animating UFO Entrance.
- attach teleport to UFO when it spawns, use ienumerator.(fixed)
- create a function to wait for some seconds to spawn next UFO.(fix)(decide pain-taking)
- speed up teleport animation.(fixed)
  -> ufo appear as teleport ends, wait for - 1.1f
- create UFO ID.(fixed)
  -> send ID to ufoSpawner when it is detroyed to set buffer location to false
  -> we can reset all to false in the buffer also.
- make dialogues same length.(fixed)
  ->txt2,txt4,txt11,txt14,txt15 - 3
  ->txt1,txt9,txt10,txt12,txt13 - 2
  ->txt3,txt0, - 1
  ->txt5,txt6, txt7,txt8, - 4
- adjust dialogue disappear.(fixed)
- adjust dialogue for txt13.(fixed)

07-11-2020

- adjust hide dialogue according to dialogue.(optional)(done)
- UFO Spawner fix it, time to enable it.(fixed)
  -> UFO spawn after all anim opening ended
- animator can be accessed with main camera object, no need to explicitly mark it.
  -> removed reference from bcakgroundScroller
- animator.play(), normalized time (how much anim has played)
  ->.25f - first over
  ->.5f - 2nd over
  ->.75f - 3rd over
  ->1f - 4th over
- using WaitForSeconds instead of checking normalizedTime in update regularly(works great)
  -> case 1(1.5f) - 0,3
  -> case 2(3f) -1,9,10,12,13,
  -> case 3(4.5f) -2,4,8,11,14,15,
  ->default -5,6,7,
- if possible, destroy all dialogues after all are said.(fix)(optional)

08-11-2020

- create dialogue if boss appears.(fix)
- opening right weapon door.(fix)
- create UI for HighScore.(fixed)
  -> update score added to set buffer in ufoSpawner
  -> points - 10, for normal UFO
  -> created text object for containing Score
  -> create a separate script for saving high score?
  -> save system is done
- create separate scene for opening credit.(fix)(optional)
- create power ups?(optional)
- create main menu.(fixed)
  -> creating menu
  -> made buttons.
  -> made settings container.
  -> make Background for menu.(fixed)
  -> gear icon for settings.(fix)(not done this)(didnt need this)
  -> attach button functionality.(fixed)
- add music and sound.(fix)
- can add sensitivity settings in menu.(optional)

- skip anim if seen at least once.(fix)(done)
- 1st test.
  ->works!!
- build back button, or wait for input of back button to go back.(fixed)
  ->go for 2nd approach.
- loading happens fast, no need for loading bar, loading sequence can be blinking refueling (fix)
  -> loading done then, ready goes green from red.
  -> play sound to turn ready green.
  -> loading finished, wait sometime for ready to turn green, ready green then wait a while, load finally
- no need of volume control, but can replace it with sensitivity controls,no sensitivity controls
- two separate button for music and sound. (fixed)
  -> connect sound to script.
- create sprites.(fix)(done)
- separate music for both main menu and game?
- pause menu contains two options :- (fixed)

12-11-2020

- made all the sprites that i can remember.
- bullets hit animation.
- ship destroyed anim.
- main title height -> 600.
- added sprites.(can improve)

13-11-2020

- boss fires laser, first charge then fire.(fix)(done)
- make transition main bckgrnd.(fixed)
  ->one fades out, while the next is loaded, and process repeats.
  -> can create code in update to fade out.
  -> In case of anim, have to create two anim.(done)
  -> made a fixed bckgrnd so during transition there is a bckgrnd.
  -> fade in, wait, change bckgrnd, fade out, wait and repeat.
  -> the code works amazingly!
- bug:-
  -> UFO don't properly spawn in their position, they get down from their position.
  -> may have to change script and do the background move approach.
- create buttons. text isnt visible properly.(done)
- loading transition is great.

14-11-2020

- added some main images and transition between them.
- added toggle function for both music and sound effects.
- music toggle added to local but how to reference in next scene?
  -> works good but the music restarts every time.
  
15-11-2020

- add weapon sound effect to the gun and not the bullet, same with everything.
- score container appears as the game starts, i.e. after all anims.
- collision detection can be done so that, it only checks for collision when it is near the rocket,
   i.e. check for collision of ammo of player or enemy when it is within the area of contact, define
   a box and when the bullet enters it, start for checking collision then.(fix)(optimisation)
- Boss can spawn Landmines type thingy using teleport if, movement script is changed to bckgrnd move,
  telport wont go to waste, also increase teleport anim.(fix)(didnt do it)
- dont know if i can add retart functionality to the game for now, dont know how to do it.(fix)
- sprite:- pause, resume, restart, main menu, pause icon.(done)
- add back input functionaity.(fixed)
- pause logic works.
- removed exit from the pause menu.
- can have two of the main bckgrnd, and if camera reaches the point, then move the first to spawnPoint,
  while the second is in camera.(fixed)(done)
  -> working better than expected, had to increase size of bckgrnd to 1.2, so span distance = 12.96 now
  ->commenting out extra code from earlier, maybe save the detect system.
- bckgrnd still dont move.(fixed)
- position raycast according to bckgrnd.(fixed)

16-11-2020

- fix shoot script of both.(fix)
- did not move raycast, but adjusted the detect boxes.
- bckgrnd moves now.
- dialogue is starting trouble again, its good, dialogue again was turned off.(fixed)
- fixed the firing script.
- can add a progress system.(optional)
- added exit button to pause panel.
- loading and unloading works perfectly.
- can have a separate script just for loading.
  -> dont destroy on load and transition in script.
  -> scene 0-1 :- REFUELING
  -> scene 1-0 :- LOADING.
- added the bcak button functionality to credits in main menu.
- just have to play loading anim until loading is done then, unload the current level will happen 
  automatically.
- can check for button press to start loading/refueling anim.
- duplicates are being made.(fixed)
- loading works perfectly.
- change UFO entrance anim.
  -> increase x and y of position by 0.1f, until they reach the designated position.
  -> it somewhat works, but the speed is too much, decreasing by 0.01f
  
18-11-2020

- fix the shooting script, when time scale is 0f.(fixed)
- fix everything that works when time scale is 0f.(fixed)
  - moved code to FixedUpdate.
- increase UFO Speed.(fixed)
  -> speed is ok for now.
- set spawn points for UFO according to locations in screen.(fixed)
  -> y = 2 is enough for every UFO, on the 2nd row also. This will remain constant.
  -> spawn point is same, but can make a vector3 array to contain co-ordinates on how to move.
  -> Middle :-  
              - 0, 0.8, -0.8
			  - new vector3(0f,2f,0f)
			  - position.x is not calculated
  -> Left   :-  
              - x < (-0.8)
			  - new vector3(-2f,2f,0f)
			  - transform.position.x >= realLocation.x
			  - transform.Translate(0.05f, 0f, 0f); , in both else if and else.
  -> Right  :-  
              - x > (+0.8)
			  - new vector3(2f,2f,0f)
			  - transform.position.x <= realLocation.x
			  - transform.Translate(-0.05f, 0f, 0f);, in both else if and else.
- UFO arrive at location but slide down or up after few seconds.
  -> not an issue, moving in editor was issue. only use x in editor.
- transform.position.x >= realLocation.x, can shorten this with a local bool and inverting it
  whenever required, or it stays the same.
- spawn point is not working properly.(fixed)
  -> toggleLeftOrRight was set to 0.5 and not to 0.05.
- toggleLeftOrRight = 0 is not working properly;

19-11-2020

- incraese rocket shoot speed.(fixed)
- testing toggle for 1.
  -> works good.
- toggle test for 0 also works well.
- do boss fight.(fix)(done)
- the lower 2 layers have to add 4 instead of 2, as they are in screen if 2 is added.
- bug: the enemy ships werent going to location and moving forward without stopping, if they were
       in the lower 2 layers and tempToggleY was set to 4.
    -> the logic is flawed, addd same digits, i.e. 2 so increment or decrement happens in such a way,
       that the two if and else-if statements are never reached, also I have calculated them as they
       are passed to the UFOController script and not again, so reached x is never printed, LOL. You
       can try it, so the solution is to manually calculate evrytime by writing condition in every if
       and else statement or calculate it every time I enter the first if statement.
- gettospawn gets executed too many times.(fixed)
- enemy gets to their location properly, but notAtLocation doesnt work properly.(fixed)
  -> should be greater than and not less than.
- UFO shoot after getting to location.(Fixed)
- skip anim if seen at least once.(fix)(done)
- can set the leader canon on pedestal beneath and rotate the pedestal when firing.

20-11-2020

- set canon location to (-0.64) in anim after lowering down. Original location is (-0.33) (fix)(done)
- do boss script.(fix)(done)
- increase boss shoot speed, get a local variable to keep speed.(fix)(done)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 CONCEPT
  :- the canon float beneath the UFOBoss, and when the laser fires the canon move out of the way, or
     sideways.
  :- the second gun goes underways the first one.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	 

- the canon container has different values in editor and debug.log.(fixed)
- the sprites don't go so well for screen. i.e. Main Menu, Reloading....(fixed)
- change UFOBoss x position to 0f from 2f. (fixed)
- UFOBoss doesnt fire from 2nd point only after animation is enabled, without anim, it works good.(fixed)
  -> animator isnt the issue, it doesnt fire at all after first time.
  -> index was set to wrong thing, my fault.
- enemy shoot speed is 120, boss set to ...., player to 70
  -> the boss can have burst firing for few seconds and then cool off.(fix)(done)
  -> make other weapon system for Boss.(fix)(done)
  -> Boss fire rate set to 10 for starters, decrease to increase speed.
- decrease ammo despawn distance.(fixed)
  -> 10f is perfect for both
- set code for boss to appear.(fix)(done)
- Boss fight :-
             -> Burst fire for 3 seconds.
			 -> fire missiles for at least same.
			 -> wait for at least 5 seconds.
- can make a separate class in UFOController for Boss.(fix)(done)
  -> it would be better to make a different script.(yeah, perhaps this would be best.)
  -> damage taken, fire rate (burst rate), missiles spawn, laser spawn,lower weapon, follow player or
     sway a little, progress system.
- progress system based on score, a global public variable for difficulty.

22-11-2020
 
BOSS:-
-----------------------------------
- Boss approaches player and continues to fire for 3 seconds, then turns away from the player, and does not
  shoot at the player for approx. 5 seconds, recharges then, shoots back at the player.
  -> did the burst thing.
  -> boss takes damage.
  -> boss has force field when firing, make anim.(fixed)
  -> made the shield.
- the sprites are not at their positions in game. (fixed)
- prefab cant be assigned a gameobject from the scene.(fixd)
  -> the bar works.
  
23-11-2020

- can make a single anim for both appearing and disappearing of the Boss main shield.(fix)(done)
- canon charge for laser anim.(fix)(done)
  -> laser scale - 120 , position y - (-37.5)
  -> shoot laser turned off.(fixed)
  -> set laser position.(fix)(done)
  
24-11-2020

- canon laser:- 
  -> draw a ray from the outer lines to detect hit from laser, both sides.(fixed)
  ->can use isShooting for laser also.(fixed)
  -> can add anothet int to waitforgivenseconds for controlling recharge time or something else.(fix)(done)
  -> code the recharge mechanism.(fix)(done)
  -> shoot, turn off shield, shoot, turn off shield, recharge laser, shoot laser, turn off shield,
     shield turns on, shoot , turn off shield, fire missiles, turn on shield and process repeats. 
  -> canon rechargetime should be short, like 1.5 seconds .(fix)(done)
  -> shield turns on - sound is genrator turning on, electire type, electric car increasing power, acc.
  -> can turn off rotate weapons as the shield recharges.(fix)(not needed)
  -> shield immediately ends, has to be more than 3 seconds.(fixed)
  -> boss gets heavier as weapons increases.(fix)(didnt do it)
  -> drawRay length 8 is enough and damage 5 is ok.
- boss follows player.
- cant escape boss bullet if 5 seconds.
  -> either slow the boss or decrease fire rate.
  -> if the boss is slowered, then while fire, the boss will be slow and then when shields are down, 
     boss will be fast.(fix)(didnt do it)
  -> can provide power up to shield from Boss.
  -> when firing again after recharge, wait for shield to go up.(fix)(done)
  -> set path for UfoBoss to come down.(fix)(done)
- can setup anim for first occurence of Boss Ship a.k.a. War Ship.(fix)(didnt do it)
- health bar appears when boss comes down.
- player can move during dialogue.(fix)(feature)
- door opens after defeating first boss, and taking down some ships.
- change bckgrnd to dark, so to see bullets.(fix)(done)
- increase boss health, doesnt have to be that strong, but as a first boss has to be strong(fix)(done)
- for some reason the laser seems to want to go downwards after some time by itself.(fixed)
  ->check for animators. turning off anim does not do anything.
  -> turns out i have already written code for it in wait for given seconds.
  
25-11-2020

- make a int array with shoot, fire, fire missile as index and value as how many times it happens.(fix)(done)
  -> cam also use this to store how many bosses killed, so as to increase difficulty with progress.(fix)(done)
- some algorithm for firing weapons:-
  -> intToggle[0] -   3           -> intToggle[0] -   2          -> intToggle[0] -   2
     intToggle[1] -   1              intToggle[1] -   1             intToggle[2] -   2
     intToggle[0] -   1              intToggle[2] -   1             intToggle[0] -   2
     intToggle[2] -   2              intToggle[0] -   1             intToggle[1] -   1
  -> baseline is that :-
     (-) First Boss will only shoot bullets.
	 (-) Second Boss will shoot bullets as well as lasers.
	 (-) Can introduce missiles at third Boss or later at 4th or 5th.(assuming people will play that long)
     (-) Before shooting laser, there should be at least be 2 times bullets be shot, i.e. 2-3 times
     (-) Missiles can be shot, maximum 2 times, at any given time, i.e. 1-2 times
	 (-) Limited no. of missiles can only be shot or for some intervals. (5 sec with 0.1 in between)
	     - use intToggle2 for counting missiles.( 10 missiles)
	 (-) Laser could only be shot 1 time, at any given time, i.e. 1 time
	 (-) reset intToggle2 after a boss dies.
	 (-) can laser and missile fire alternatively? If so then can make a function to check the progress.
- may need an extra script for missile navigation.(fix)(done)
  -> can add a class down the boss script for missile nav.
- code to shoot be random every time or be fixed for a boss?
- different point for different boss.(fix)(done)
- can make different function for progress system, as most code will be repeated.(fix)(done)
- made a progress system.
  -> test the system(fix)(done)
  
28-11-2020

- testing the progress system
  -> turning off UFO spwner.(fixed)
  -> set boss defeated to 0.
     (-) goes well, shield work properly, weapon system is ok.
  -> set boss defeated to 1 || 2.(fixed)
     (-) shield turned on, nothing happened, boss defeated is printed, boss defeated printed again, bullets
	     start to fire, shields on,bullets continue, boss defeated, bullets continue, this happens most fo 
		 the times, causes the bullets to fire morw than longer.
     (-) laser fired only once.
  -> doesnt work well.
     (-) soemtimes doesnt wait for recharge, just keeps firing.
  -> turn on collider for player.(fixed)
  -> after shooting most system are not recharging, and firing continuosly, will have to introduce an int in 
     WaitForSeconds to know which weapon was fired before recharging.(fixed)
  -> after shooting laser, recharge does not happen normally, shield stays on and bullets start to shoot, 
     have to turn off anim just like in bullet part of WaitForSeconds.(fixed)
	 (-) moved the recharge code to WaitForSeconds(4)
  -> shooting laser another time does not work properly, the laser is not extended.(fixed)
     (-) laser in position
  -> laser shot after shooting bullets only once.(fixed)
     (-) after shooting laser, bullets shoot, bullets are enough, switch to laser, laser shoot.
	 (-) in progress system, if else was set to 1, turned to 2.
  -> boss defeated set to 2 also works well.

- make anim for rockets and script also.(fixed)
  -> can attach ammo script to rocket also.
- shield is still up when laser is fired. (fixed)

29-11-2020

- adjust the no. of missile fired.(fixed)
- if boss makes appearence, no of UFO spawned should be low, and outside of Boss's range.(fixed)

01-12-2020

- increase missile speed.(fixed)
  -> 4f seems good.
  -> rocket size - X: 0.21 ,Y: 0.315
- fix instantiating missiles. (fixed)

03-12-2020

- move towards is better for missile.
- after firing missile,
  -> boss begins to tilt and only fires bullet afterwards.
  -> boss fires laser correctly.
  -> boss begins to tilt, fires bullets, fires missiles, continues to fire missile.
  -> missile counter does not reset.(fixed)
 (-) increasing missile speed. (did not fix)
 (-) making the UFO parent of missile may be the problem.
  -> removed missile from parent, works good, UFO does not tilt, but continues to fire while missile are still 
     going, shields, bullet fire, shields, missile fire but only 2 and missiles are fired more than 10.
  -> laser does not work properly. (fixed)
  -> after shooting missiles, other system gets activated immediately.
     => fires missile, shields on but laser is fired, shields off, laser continues to fire, laser stops, shields,
	    bullets, missile count is not reset. As missile count not reset, index reaches +10.
	 => creating a problem(fixed)
  -> laser shot,but shields were on. Shields remain on during both Boss Defeated 1 and 2
- the system works fine except the lasers!!
- remove the serializable field.(fix)

04-12-2020

- 10 missiles may be a bit of excess.(fixed)

- make wave of UFO's for the Progress System.

05-12-2020

- dont disbale the polygon collider except disable the take damage function when shields are on for Boss.(fix)(done)
- as boss follows player, enemy UFO will overlap, even if they are set to avoid Boss area when Boss follows 
  the player. So, set the enemy UFO spawn point downwards below Boss, and let Boss recharge while doing nothing,
  Boss recharges back as soon as Enemy UFO are destroyed.Can regenerate the health of Boss when enemy UFO appear.
  Reset Boss position to, x:0/y:4 , when Boss is regenerating health.(fix)(optional)
- after 3rd bullet shoot, shields off, shields on, goes to recharge point.
- regenerate works.
- shields are on during regenerate.(fixed)

07-12-2020

- spaw point : upper - 2 -> 17,18,19 / index -> 2,3,4
               lower, lower - 2 -> 24,25,26,27 / index -> 9,10,11,12    ,24,25,26,27,28
- 10 for recharge seems too long, need to shorten it up.(fix)(done)
- goes to recharge location, shields off, starts to shoot, follow player, shields on anim does not play but 
  shields off anim does play.(fixed)
- spawn UFO underneath Boss when the BOss regenerates.(fix)(done)
- transition from dialogue to main game causes possibleToSpawn be called too many times.(fix)
- fixed the enemy wave code and Boss spawn also works well.

- feel like dialogues are too long.(fix)(done)
- make Boss and enemy system progression different.(fixed)(think so)
- when game over, show current score of the player.(fix)(done)
- high score glitch.(fixed)
- (enemyWave % 6==0) this does not function properly, as the starting value is 0.(fixed)
- a single variable for progression and a different variable for updating the progression variable. Maybe need 
  a variable to check if its the first wave.
- Boss appears after every 8th wave and progree occurs after every 6th wave.
- enemy isnt shooting.(fixed)
- also increase Rocket fire rate.(fix)
- progress system works but not as intended :
  -> before spawning UFO, Score and FR Holder start to increase greatly until all the 6 UFO have spawned
  -> situation worsened and enemy wave also increases now. Get back from waitseconds in ufospwner.(fix)
